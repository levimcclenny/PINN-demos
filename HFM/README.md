This a Tensorflow 2.x port of Maizir Raissi's 2D cylinder problem [1]. This is a standalone script used to generate the network weights used in
Txas A&M Univsersity's SciML Demo found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gZVcy72_TxFleGmPiMHZ4-pa0P_RxVq-?usp=sharing).

This requires a lo installation of tensorflow, numpy, and tensorflow probability. We recommend docker containers to install all the required CUDA libraries, 
available from the [Tensorflow Team](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker)
